## Project Summary

This project seeks to analyze School Advantage Programs funding by the New York City borough and compare it to its corresponding borough's English Language Arts test (ELA) and its mean score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between how much funding a borough invested in advantage programs for students and how well students performed on the ELA test. After my analysis, it is inconclusive/difficult to draw a conclusion on whether the two are correlated due to 1) the scales being vastly different 2) an insufficient way to visualize the data next to each other, and 3) the Mean Scores being close in range.

## Attributes

Contract End Date (string) - the date at which the school stopped receiving funding
Contract Amount (integer) - the dollar amount of funding the school received
Primary City/Borough (string) - inner boroughs/cities within New York City, the same column in 2 different data sets
Mean Scale Score (float) - the average score of each borough's ELA scores
